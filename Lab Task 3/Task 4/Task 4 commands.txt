** Discussion:

1. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) requires padding because it operates on fixed-size blocks and needs complete blocks to work with during encryption.

2. ECB (Electronic Codebook) requires padding for the same reason as CBC – it operates on fixed-size blocks and needs complete blocks to encrypt.

3. CFB (Cipher Feedback) generally does not require padding because it operates on individual bits or bytes rather than fixed-size blocks.

4. OFB (Output Feedback) generally does not require padding for the same reason as CFB – it operates on individual bits or bytes rather than fixed-size blocks.
